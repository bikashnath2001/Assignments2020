                            Eligibility for the Vistadeck Offers program and any price delivered or displayed as an “initial offer” or “market value”
                            are subject to change if property information is found to be incomplete or inaccurate. The amount of the “initial offer”
                            and any Vistadeck projected “market value” is based on recent sales in the area in which the subject property is located
                            and the home’s list-ready condition. A home evaluation will be performed as part of the Vistadeck Offers process to verify
